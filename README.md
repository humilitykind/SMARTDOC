## üß© Architecture

### Key Components

1. **File Processing Pipeline**:
   - Detects file type and processes files accordingly.
   - Uses temporary files for efficient handling.

2. **Chunking**:
   - Splits large text into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

3. **Vectorstore**:
   - Embeds document chunks using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.
   - Stores embeddings in a FAISS vectorstore for fast retrieval.

4. **Conversational Chain**:
   - Powered by `ChatOpenAI` for intelligent responses.
   - Uses `ConversationBufferMemory` to maintain chat history.

5. **Streamlit UI**:
   - Provides an interactive interface for uploading files, processing documents, and chatting.

## üêõ Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Encoding Errors**:
   - If you encounter encoding issues with JSON or text files, ensure the file is UTF-8 encoded.

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all required Python packages are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **API Key Errors**:
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains valid API keys.

### Debug Logs
- Debug logs are commented in the code to help identify issues during file processing.
- Check the terminal output for detailed error messages.
